# Boost asio test

This `boost::asio` code is being developed for another project where I need to read serial data sending RPM from an experimental Arduino device.

Disclaimer: this is not polished code! It has been developed from the simplest `boost::asio` synchrnous examples as a sort of minimum viable product to get me up and running. Regardless, it serves as a nice simple example of reading ports and threading that I will probably come back to for personal future reference.
